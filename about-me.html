	<section><!-- Biography -->
        <h3>Short Bio</h3>
        <p>I'm old enough that I'm starting to feel a little bit like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/">Forrest Gump</a>. I'm too young to have experienced Watergate and the moon landing, but I remember where I was when I found out the Challenger exploded. I worked on a Y2K project. I was living in NYC on 9/11.</p>
        <p>I worked for The Associated Press for more than a decade as an election coordinator, compiling election data, populating state databases and building tabulation tables, and supervising state-level election night operations. The technology was really neat, and my peers were amazing... but it was <em>extremely</em> stressful.</p>

	<section><!-- Education -->
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I graduated with an undergraduate degree in Classics from Reed College. Ten years after that, I left my full-time job to go back to school to study graphic design. Ten years after that, I spent a year at the University of Washington studying natural science illustration, and then a year at USC (online) getting a graduate certificate in GIS.</p>
        <p>Now I'm working on an MLIS through <a href="https://ischool.sjsu.edu">San Jose State University</a> (post-coordinate controlled vocabulary, anyone?), along with a certificate in front-end development (this program!).</p>

        <h3>Volunteering</h3>
        <p>I was freelancing as a graphic designer (and losing interest <em>fast</em>) when Covid shut everything down, including whatever work I had trickling in. (It was kind of a relief, actually.) Thankfully, I had been volunteering as a raptor docent at my local outdoor learning center for many years, and because that involves caring for live animals, I consistently had a place to go and something that needed to be done.</p>

        <p>I love working with unreleasable raptors, and other volunteers, and working with the birds doing community outreach.</p>

        <h4>Nature Journaling as a Master Naturalist</h4>
        <p>One focus of my master naturalist program was keeping a nature journal. I ended up hand-binding my journal and making a cover.</p>

        <p>Winter 2022-2023 has been quite cold and snowy -- I did not see my first snowdrops until the end of March! I'm looking forward to warmer weather and spending time outside.</p>
        <article>
            <h4>Speaking of nature journaling...</h4>
            <p>It is becoming a topic of interest among educators and scholars. I for one, am glad to see it.</p>
            <h4>Creative Connecting: Early Childhood Nature Journaling Sparks Wonder and Develops Ecological Literacy</h4>
            <blockquote>"Young children have an inherent sense of wonder and connection to their natural world which can be preserved and enhanced through the cultivation of observation and documentation."</blockquote>
