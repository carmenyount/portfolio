		<h2>Why I'm here.</h2>
		<p>Couple of reasons... For one thing, I'm an MLIS student (at <a href="https://ischool.sjsu.edu/">San Jose State University</a>), and I wanted to supplement my information science curriculum with some technology.</p>
		<p>And, apparently this skillset is somewhat in demand out in the "real world."</p>
		<p>To wit:</p>

			<h3>Are Front End Developers in Demand in 2023?</h3>
			<blockquote>"Many people think front-end developers are going extinct. However, data and reality reveal that the industry is expanding and that there is a tremendous demand for front-end developers."</blockquote>

		<h2>Portfolio (in my mind)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>A think I did: Assignment #1</li>
			<li>A "sort of" technology project: my blog, <a href="https://carmenyount.com">carmenyount.com</a>. (Ok, so it's a Wordpress blog, but someday maybe I'll be able to design my own theme... maybe)</li>
			<li>Aspirational: I would like to map the perennial garden at one of our local parks and make a website devoted to it, with a plant database and a map.</li>
