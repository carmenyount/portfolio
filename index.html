		<h2>Goals for this program and beyond:</h2>
		<p>When I was first exposed to HTML, it was in the days when we were still using QuarkXpress and appropriating tables to create page layouts for the web. Cascading Style Sheets were a revollutionary thing, but they weren't a <em>widely used</em> thing. (Those of us who were deep in Quark and transitioning to InDesign were <em>psyched</em>, because as it turns out, a style sheet is a style sheet is a style sheet. In other words, when people say "1996 called -- it wants its website back," I actually remember what that website looked like... and it was not pretty.</p>
		<p>I went on to into print design and production and left the web behind (except as a user).</p>
		<p>Fast forward to now... many years later... I'm an MLIS student at <a href="https://ischool.sjsu.edu">SJSU</a>and a group I was working with had to use <a href="https://https://www.caspio.com/">Caspio</a> to build a small database for a class. As it turns out, interacting with Caspio works <em>way better</em> if you have a grasp of Javascript, which I don't. (No one in my group did, and it wasn't the point of the class, but it sure would have been helpful.)</p>
		<p>I have a deep and abiding appreciation for information science. It's essential that people have access to information in ways that make sense for them.</p>
		<p>And just about everything these days is web-based, so in order to be an effective information professional, I probably should be as well. Ultimately, I would like to be a front-end developer specializing in content management, but I have a <em>whole bunch</em> of other interests, including natural science illustration and nature journaling, so we'll see where all of this ends up...</p>
		<p>(Also, apparently this skill set is somewhat in demand out in the "real world.")</p>
